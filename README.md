# Supply-analyst-Power-BI
Project Description:
This project provides an end-to-end supply chain analytics solution built using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive dashboard development. The primary objective is to uncover key operational insights, identify business problems, and address data challenges across different supply chain metrics.

Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – for data cleaning and preprocessing
Power BI – for dashboard creation and data visualization

Dashboard Features:
KPIs:

Total Orders: xx

Gross Sales: xx

Profit: xx

Inventory Cost: xx

Fulfillment Days: xx


Analysis Breakdown:
Year-wise Sales & Profit by Product
Customer Market-Wise Revenue (Top: Europe & LATAM)
Top Performing Countries (India, China, USA, etc.)
Product Department Costs
Shipment Mode Performance
Delivery On-Time vs Delayed
Stock Status Distribution

Business Insights Identified:
High fulfillment time (629+ days) indicates inefficiencies in order processing or logistics.
Delivery delays (41% not on time) raise customer satisfaction concerns.
Standard class dominates the shipment mode, but needs review for speed vs cost.
Europe & LATAM contribute the most to revenue – signaling strong market presence.
Inventory cost concentrated in Apparel, Fan Shop, and Golf – potential for optimization.


Challenges Faced:
Missing values and inconsistent formats in raw data
Uneven product categorization and mapping
Performance optimization for large dataset visuals in Power BI
Identifying underperforming SKUs with low profit margins

Outcome:
The dashboard successfully highlights opportunities for inventory cost reduction, delivery improvement, and customer market targeting. These insights can help in making strategic supply chain decisions to boost efficiency and profitability.
